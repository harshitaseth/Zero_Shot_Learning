# Multi-modal-Multi-Task-learning-for-Tag-based-Music-Retrieval-and-Music-Instrument-Identification
A multitask algorithm to perform music instrument classification and tag-based music information retrieval. We have also done multimodal learning where we have used text tags along with audio files. We have performed metric learning for tag classification and ecross entropy loss for music instrument classification and observed joint training of both tasks increased the accuracy of music instrument classification.
